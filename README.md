# React `useRef` and `useState` Example

This repository demonstrates the use of React's `useRef` and `useState` hooks in a simple component.

## Features

- **useRef Hook**: Used to persist a mutable value across renders without causing a re-render.
- **useState Hook**: Handles state updates and re-renders the component when state changes.
- **React `createRef`**: Used to reference a DOM element and manipulate it directly.
